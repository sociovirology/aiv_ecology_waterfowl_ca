#So 17.452% mapping with 0.1405933 error rate (which is irrelevant because this is not correct reference)
#This lower mapping percentage reflects the fact we are mapping environmental influenza samples (that match the avian influenza virus genome database) against a human influenza virus genome

#In summary, we have very high mapping percentage (>92%) of our control sample to the reference genome from which they were derived
#Mapping an experimental sample to the control reference genome predictably leads to a drop in the percent reads aligning (i.e. we don't expect human influenza virus necessarily),
  #but we do get some alignment as we do have influenza virus in our sample 
#This analysis provides another line of evidence (in addition to negative controls) to boost confidence that demultiplexing was conducted properly.
