# California Sampling 
# For March 2023 WPDC Conference

Goal is to have Summer 2021 all samples analyzed.

Worst, come to worst I have Summer 2021 Swabs Analyzed in:
papers/aiv_waterfowl_california_central_valley_2021/aiv_detection_environment/CM_aiv_detection_analysis.R

Now need to analyze water and sediment samples. Good news is I can use the AIV pipeline for these two. So need to 

1. Identify where the runs are (see Sequencing Runs below)
2. Basecall and demultiplex these runs (use the most recent scripts from Ile's DI run)
3. Get metadata organized for soil and water. 
4. Run R script to call
5. If time, reconcile all 3 data sets together.

OPTIONAL: Circle back and basecall and demuliplex the swab samples

## Seasons
